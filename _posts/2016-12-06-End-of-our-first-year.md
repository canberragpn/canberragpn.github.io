title: End of our first year!
---

The Canberra Girls' Programming Network has come to the end of its first year! So far, we have taught over 100 girls at our three events.

We couldn't be happier with how our first year went. We have exceeded every goal we have set for ourselves this year.

We're taking a break now, but will back in the new year with more events to help encourage girls in STEM! Expect to hear from us in early February next year.

Enjoy the holiday break!
