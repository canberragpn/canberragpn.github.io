title: Announcing the November Canberra Girls' Programming Network Workshop
---

There has never been a more exciting time to be a female learning about technology!

The Canberra Girls’ Programming Network is a community for female students to learn about computer programming and technology through hands-on workshops. It gives girls exposure to female role models across academia, government and industry.

<p><strong><center>Our next workshop will be held on November 27th!</center></strong></p>

**Please register now by going to the [registration page](/register) and returning your completed forms to [ASD.DISH@defence.gov.au](mailto:ASD.DISH@defence.gov.au).**

## What

The workshop topic is Markov Chains. 

Markov Chains allow us to find the probability of an event happening based on what happened directly before. Using text generators and Markov Chains, we can create whole sentences and paragraphs by “predicting” a word based on the previous word in the sentence. We can then increase the accuracy of the paragraph by “training” our Markov Chain!
