title: Announcing the April 2020 Canberra Girls' Programming Network Workshop
---
**UPDATE 18 MARCH 2020 **

Thank you for registering for the GPN Canberra workshop in April. We were in the process of finalising placements but with the rapidly changing COVID-19 environment we have decided to POSTPONE the April 5th event.

We understand that this may be disappointing but the health and wellbeing of the students and our tutors/volunteers comes first.

Over the coming weeks we will assess the environment and if it’s safe to do so an alternative date may be scheduled.

Thank you for your understanding and please everyone keep safe.

~~**Registrations for this event are now closed**

~~The Canberra Girls’ Programming Network is a community for female students to learn about computer programming and technology through hands-on workshops. It gives girls exposure to female role models across academia, government and industry.
