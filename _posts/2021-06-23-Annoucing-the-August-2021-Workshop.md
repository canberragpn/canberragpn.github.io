## What

We'll be doing the NCSS Challenge!

The [National Computer Science School](http://www.ncss.edu.au/) teams up with [Grok Learning](https://groklearning.com/) every year to run the [NCSS Challenge](https://groklearning.com/challenge/)! The NCSS Challenge is an opportunity to develop your python skill over five weeks, and the Girls' Programming Network will get you started! You'll solve real world problems and compete against students all over the world.

So that we can create accounts with Grok Learning for the NCSS Challenge, each attendee will need to provide an email address as a part of the registration process. Please note: The nominated email address will not be added to any mailing list, including Grok Learning or the Canberra GPN and will only be used for the purpose of the NCSS Challenge. For more information and terms and conditions please visit https://groklearning.com/challenge/.
