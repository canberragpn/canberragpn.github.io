**<center>There has never been a more exciting time to be a girl in IT!</center>**

The Canberra Girls' Programming Network runs free, hands-on programming workshops for girls in grades 4--12. Girls are introduced to a range of topics such as cryptography and games and code their own programs using the Python programming language. No coding experience is necessary! Events are run several times a year by volunteer local women studying or working in IT in industry, academia and government.

So whether you're a coding guru, or just a beginner, come along to one of our workshops and give programming a go!
