**Please Note: There are additional steps for registering for our August Event, as the topic is the NCSS Challenge. **

Registering for our next event is easy. All you need to do is to digitally fill out the following form:

 * [Canberra GPN Application Form][gpn application]

Then email the form through to [ASD](mailto:asd.acpi.outreach@defence.gov.au).

As a participant of the Canberra GPN, you will be given free access to the NCSS Challenges hosted on Grok Learning. (If you register directly you will be charged.) Grok Learning – the company who manages the NCSS Challenge – requires an email address to register your daughter. Please note: The nominated email address will not be added to any mailing list, including Grok Learning or the Canberra GPN and will only be used for the purpose of the NCSS Challenge. For more information and terms and conditions please visit https://groklearning.com/challenge/. 

Steps required:
* Please send the nominated email address with your registration form. If your daughter is in grade 7 or above, their school email address is suitable. Note: each child will need a different email address.

* If your daughter already has an account please let us know when you send through the email address so we can link the account to the GPN.

You will recieve a confirmation email once the registration process is complete.
