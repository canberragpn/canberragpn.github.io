Keeping your secrets safe is just plain hard! Especially if you have nosey people in your family who wonâ€™t stop snooping around!
In this workshop you'll make a security chatbot that will keep your secrets safe and trick any snoops lurking around. Only people with the real password will be able to access the secrets.
